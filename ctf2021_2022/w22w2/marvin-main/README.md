# marvin

Description:

```
On October first, 2021, during the first ctf-league meeting of the 2021-2022
school year, the ultra stable and super secure marvin was hacked
(unintentionally) by one of our very own ctf-league players who had a single
quote in their username. Luckily, no sensitive data was exposed and the bug(s)
were fixed the same night that it was discovered. Tonight we're taking a step
back in time, to find out how much damage the vulnerabilities would have caused
if they had been left unchecked. The flag for tonight's challenge has been added
to old_marvin's database. Good luck!

Hint: Bot commands in discord.py allow you to pass a string with spaces
as an argument when you surround the argument with double quotes.
